# Main theme for 2017

In 2017 I was diving even deeper within the rice 
community, so I needed to step my game up.

I started using KLWP, and the theme file is listed 
above. I am still kinda noobish at it, the depth
transition should definitely be on swipe rather than
on tap. The aesthetic of the pape is really trendy
right now though so I like it a lot. There are a 
lot of skins right now that are splicing images onto
blank color backgrounds.
